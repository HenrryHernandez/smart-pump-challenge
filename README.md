# First

I would like to thank you for this challenge. I really enjoyed building it ðŸ˜„

# Notes

- At least node version 18 is needed (in case it doesn't work, try with version 20)
- This is a mono-repository, that is, two projects are inside one repository. This is so to follow your folders' structure and make it easy for you to find everything.
- I know that exposing the .env file in a repository is a huge NO-NO, however, since this is a demo, I put it there to make it more straightforward to test.
- I changed some of the profile pictures for ones in the /public so the Avatar icon could look a bit better than the generic http://placehold.it/32x32. Also, I removed the picture from one user to test the fallback of the Avatar, that is, when the user doesn't have a profile picture, a default avatar is set. (Check the users.json, field "picture" to understand better).
